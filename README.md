# #✨🪽 Light of Heaven – Demo


🎮 JavaScript-Metroidvania Game Get a taste of Light of Heaven, a retro-inspired Metroidvania adventure where betrayal burns brighter than the stars.


In this early demo, you step into the role of Seraphine, a fallen angel with no memory and a bleeding wing. Guided by a suspiciously charming axolotl named Makio, you must navigate a broken world, uncover lost powers, and reclaim the Six Heavenly Virtues to return to the skies above. But not everything is what it seems...
As you ascend through each level, defeat bosses, and unlock new abilities like double jump, glide, and powerful weapons, the truth behind your fall begins to unravel—leading to a final twist that turns heaven on its head.
